  Respond to a lawsuit
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Respond to a lawsuit** Easy Form.

  This program helps you respond to a lawsuit by making an *Appearance* form that tells the court and the other parties that you are participating in a court case. It can make a *Jury Request* if you want a jury and a judge to decide your case.

  It also makes an *Answer* form that tells the court and the other parties how you respond to what is written in the complaint or petition.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**responding to a lawsuit**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32236).

  * The Summons that orders you to go to court and the deadline for filing a written response,

  You can find this information on the court papers you have about this case. 

  Set aside 5 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later.

  After you finish this program
subquestion: |
  After you download your **{Appearance}**, **{Jury Request}**, and **{Answer}** forms, you must file them with the court. This program does not file your forms for you.
  
  Read the "How to Prepare and Send an Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition" instructions you can download at the end of this program.

  - "Jury Request": |
      A Jury Request tells the court you want a trial with a judge and a jury. It is also called a Jury demand.

question: |
  Lawsuit information
subquestion: |
  If you received a Complaint or Petition and a Summons, you have been sued. You need to tell the court you want to participate in your case. You tell the court you are participating in the case by filing an **{Appearance}**. In some cases, you need to file an **{Answer}** to respond to the Complaint or Petition.

  The Summons you received will tell you the deadline for filing your Appearance and Answer. If you do not respond by the deadline, you can be found in default, and the court can rule against you.

subject: |
  **Do I need to file a written Answer?**
content: |  
  There are two kinds of cases where you must appear in person but are not required to file a written Answer:

  * The lawsuit is for money and involves $10,000 or less. This is called a Small Claims case.
  * An eviction lawsuit (formerly called Forcible Entry and Detainer).
  
  Although you are not required to file an Answer before you go to court for these types of cases, the judge might order you to file an Answer after you go to court.

question: |
  Think about defenses
subquestion: |
  There can be many defenses to a lawsuit. However, a few special defenses must be brought up **before** you file your Answer. If you want to:

  You need to file a Motion **before** you file your Answer if you want to:
  
  * Challenge the way the Complaint or Petition were delivered to you, also called service of process, or
  * Dismiss the Complaint or Petition because the lawsuit does not have a legal basis.

  You should talk with a lawyer about whether you have a legal reason to challenge how the Complaint or Petition was received or whether you have a legal reason to have it dismissed. You can also read ILAO's article about a [**Motion to Quash**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/50146).

  Important information for evictions

  In an eviction, you must go to court but you are usually not required to file a written response. The judge might order you to file an Answer after you go to court.

  Eviction is different than other court cases. There are special court forms just for evictions. ILAO has an Easy Form that explains eviction law and helps you make the forms you need.

  If you are a tenant being sued by your landlord, use the [**Respond to an eviction**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/respond-eviction) Easy Form instead. If you are not in an eviction case, click **Next**.

question: |
 Does the court case have the words "**In re:**" in the name?
subquestion: |
  Look at the name of the case at the top of the court papers. "In re" is often used in probate, bankruptcy, and some family law cases. For example, a probate case regarding Jane Doe’s estate might be called "In re: Estate of Jane Doe."
  
  **Note:** If the court papers list the names of people in the case, you can select **No**. For example, if the case title is "In re: Marriage of Julia Smith and Tony Smith," the names you already entered will be put on your forms.

  **Note:** You do not have a right to a jury trial in every case. There can be an additional fee for a jury trial.

  - A judge: Judge only
  - A judge and a 6-person jury: Judge and six-person jury

---
template: jury_trial_help
subject: |
  **What's the difference between a 6-person jury and a 12-person jury?**
content: |  
  The number of people on the jury can affect the cost. Usually, a 12-person jury is more expensive. Ask your local circuit clerk about the fees.
  
  In Illinois, different kinds of cases allow different size juries. A 6-person jury or a 12-person jury might not be an option for your type of court case. Contact your local circuit clerk to find out what size jury is available in your case.
  
  Use the [**Illinois Court's website**](https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/courts-directory/interactive-map/by-court-type) to look up your local circuit clerk.
